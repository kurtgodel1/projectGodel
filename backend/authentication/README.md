# User Models and Authentication APIs

## This directory contains the Django models for user authentication and the API views and serializers for user registration, login, and logout.

The following files will be created and updated for this functionality:

1. `models.py`: Defining user models.
1. `api_views.py`: API views for registration, login, and logout.
3. `api_serializers.py`: Serializers for handling user data.
4. `jwt_authentication.py`: Setting up JWT-based authentication.
